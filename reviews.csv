Review
"Whoever changed the prices recently, I just want to talk. Example: the chocolate lava cakes use to be $3.99 for 2. Now they're $6.99 for 3. So you get 1 more cake and have to pay the same price for 2 twice. I don't know. Maybe it's just me loving food too much, but that's unfair to me and I'm disappointed. Haha."
